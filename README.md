Rapid SSH Proxy. Like `ssh -ND`, but much faster.

`rsp` is a SSH client which implements SOCKS5 proxy feature of SSH protocol. Key feature of this implementation is use of multiple connections to overcome downsides of multiplexing many tunneled TCP connections in single SSH session. Multiple sessions are not limited with TCP window size of single connection and packet loss does not affect all tunneled connections at once. In order to cut latency of connection establishment `rsp` maintains pool of steady connections, which replenished with configurable rate.

## Features

* High speed as compared to conventional OpenSSH client.
* Cross-platrorm (Windows, Linux, macOS and other Unix-like systems).
* Zero-setup required for server. `rsp` can be used right away with any SSH server.
* Self-sufficient: doesn't require OpenSSH on client side to operate.
* SOCKS5 remote DNS support.
* Connection establishment latency hidden from user with asynchronous connection pool.
* Connection establishment rate limit guards user from being threated as SSH flood.
* Supports transparent mode of operation (Linux only), which means rsp can be used on Linux gateway to wrap traffic of entire network seamlessly.

## Performance

Tested with Debian 9 server through 100Mbps connection. Round trip time to server is 128 ms, average packet loss is about 0.5%.

Client is a Linux desktop (Fedora 30, Python 3.7.3, OpenSSH 8.0p1).

## Installation

#### From PyPI

```sh
pip3 install rsp
```

#### From source

Run in a source directory:

```sh
pip3 install .
```

Windows note: make sure you have Python3 installed and executable locations added into your PATH enviroment variable (it's an option available during install). Also make sure to run install command from Administrator command line.

#### From Snap Store

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/rsp)

```sh
sudo snap install rsp
```

Note: in snap version `rsp`, `rsp-trust` and `rsp-keygen` binaries have names `rsp.proxy`, `rsp.trust` and `rsp.keygen` respectively.

SSH options:
  -L LOGIN, --login LOGIN
                        SSH login. Default is name of current user (default:
                        None)
  -I KEY_FILE, --identity KEY_FILE
                        SSH private key file. By default program looks for SSH
                        keys in usual locations, including SSH agent socket.

                        None)
  -P PASSWORD, --password PASSWORD
                        SSH password. If not specified, password auth will be

  --client-version CLIENT_VERSION
                        override client version string (default: None)
```

#### Usage examples

Note: host keys must be added to trusted list before proxy operation. See synopsis for `rsp-trust` utility.

Connect to example.com with SSH on port 22, using default pool size, and accept SOCKS5 connections on port 1080. Authentication is using SSH Agent and username `root`.

```
rsp -L root example.com
```

Connect to example.net with SSH on port 2222, using private key in file `proxy_key` and username `user`.

```
rsp -I proxy_key -L user example.net 2222
```

Connect to example.com with SSH on port 22, using password and username of current user:

```
rsp -P MyGoodPassword example.com
```

#### Transparent mode

In order to use `rsp` in transparent mode you should add `-T` option to command line and redirect TCP traffic to `rsp` port like this:

```sh
iptables -I PREROUTING 1 -t nat -p tcp -s 192.168.0.0/16 '!' -d 192.168.0.0/16 -j REDIRECT --to 1080
```

In this example it is assumed your local network is covered by prefix 192.168.0.0/16 and `rsp` is running on it's default port 1080.

**NOTE:** any application which supposed to accept `REDIRECT`-ed connection has to listen address on same interface where connection comes from. So, in this example you should also add command line option like `-a 192.168.0.1` or `-a 0.0.0.0` to rsp command line. Otherwise redirected connection will be refused. See also `man iptables-extension` for details on `REDIRECT` action of iptables.

### Trust management utility

```
$ rsp-trust --help
usage: rsp-trust [-h] [-H FILE] dst_address [dst_port]

  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

SSH options:
  -H FILE, --hosts-file FILE
                        overrides known_hosts file location (default:
                        /home/user/.rsp/known_hosts)
```

#### Usage examples

Get host key from example.com, port 22

```
rsp-trust example.com

Get host key from example.net, port 2222 and use non-default location of trusted keys file:

```
rsp-trust -H myhostkeysfile example.net 2222
```

### Key generation utility

                  [-t {ssh-ed25519,ssh-rsa,ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,ssh-dss}]
                  [-b BITS]

Rapid SSH Proxy: key generation utility

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -f FILE, --file FILE  output file name (default: proxy_key)
  -t {ssh-ed25519,ssh-rsa,ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,ssh-dss}, --type {ssh-ed25519,ssh-rsa,ecdsa-sha2-nistp256,ecdsa-sha2-nistp384,ecdsa-sha2-nistp521,ssh-dss}
                        key type (default: ssh-ed25519)
  -b BITS, --bits BITS  key type (default: 2048)
```

#### Usage examples

Generate SSH key with good default parameters:

```
rsp-keygen
```

Private and public key will be saved to `proxy_key` and `proxy_key.pub` respectively.
